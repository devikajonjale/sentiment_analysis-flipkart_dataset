# Sentiment Analysis on Flipkart Dataset
**The aim of this model is to analyze the sentiment of the reviews and categorize it as either positive, negative, or neutral.**
We achieve this through two methods given as follows:

1] Method 1:
- Using nltk library for text preprocessing, normalization and stemming
- Using wordcloud and piechart for visualizing the ratings

2] Method 2:
- Using nltk sentiment analyzer library
- Categorizing the ratings and scores as either positive, negative, or neutral category

**Thus, this model helps us understand customer perception of their products and allows for better product development and customer service.**
